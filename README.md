# StarEduComPomodoro

StarEduComPomodoro is a simple yet powerful web-based study productivity tool built on the principles of the **Pomodoro Technique**. It combines a focus timer, a task manager, and a long-term study tracker — all in one lightweight, distraction-free website.

The app helps students plan tasks, stay focused during study sessions, and track their long-term progress more clearly. Everything is stored in the browser via `localStorage`, so the tool works instantly without login or a server.
